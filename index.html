          Yakushima (屋久島) is one of the Ōsumi Islands in Kagoshima
          Prefecture, Japan. The island, 504.88 km2 (194.94 sq mi) in area, has
          a population of 13,178. Access to the island is by hydrofoil ferry (7
          or 8 times a day from Kagoshima, depending on the season), slow car
          ferry (once or twice a day from Kagoshima), or by air to Yakushima
          Airport (3 to 5 times daily from Kagoshima, once daily from Fukuoka
          and once daily from Osaka). Administratively, the whole island is the
          town of Yakushima. The town also serves neighbouring Kuchinoerabujima.
          42% of the island is within the borders of the Yakushima National
          Park.Yakushima is located approximately 61.3 kilometres (38.1 mi)
          south of the southern tip of Ōsumi Peninsula in southern Kyushu, or
          135 kilometres (73 nmi) south of Kagoshima. The Vincennes Strait
          (Yakushima Kaikyō) separates it from the nearby island of Tanegashima,
          which is home to the Japanese Space Centre. Periodic rocket launches
          from Tanegashima can clearly be seen from Yakushima. The bedrock of
          the island is granite, and as such it hosts no active volcanoes. It
          has an area of approximately 504.5 square kilometres (194.8 sq mi).
          The island is roughly circular in shape, with a circumference of 89
          kilometres (55 mi) and a diameter of 28 kilometres (17 mi). The
          highest elevations on the island are Miyanouradake (宮之浦岳), with a
          height of 1,935 metres (6,348 ft), and Nagatadake (永田岳), with a
          height of 1,886 metres (6,188 ft) above sea level; however, Yakushima
          has another 30 peaks of over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) in height. There
          are numerous hot springs on the island.

          Kodagu district (Kodava: [koɖɐɡɨ]) (also known by its former name
          Coorg) is an administrative district in the Karnataka state of India.
          Before 1956, it was an administratively separate Coorg State, at which
          point it was merged into an enlarged Mysore State. Madikeri is a hill
          town in southern India. Framed by the Western Ghats mountain range,
          it’s known for the Raja’s Seat, a simple monument overlooking forests
          and rice paddies. In the center, the 17th-century Madikeri Fort
          features 2 stone elephants at the entrance. Nearby, the domed
          Omkareshwar Temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. To the
          northwest, cascading Abbey Falls is surrounded by spice
          plantations.Kodagu district receives majority of its rainfall from
          Southwest Monsoon winds. It is the 4th highest average annual rainfall
          receiving district in Karnataka. The amount of rainfall varies
          significantly due to the effects of El-nino and La-nina. In the year
          2018, Kodagu received 29% excess rainfall of 3,737 millimetres (147.1
          in), 3,040 millimetres (120 in) in 2019, 2,541 millimetres (100.0 in)

          Kodagu received 11% Above-Normal rainfall of 3,036 millimetres (119.5
          in). In the year 2023, it received 38% deficit rainfall of 1,690
          millimetres (67 in)

          Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island country
          and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. The country's territory
          comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one
          outlying islet. It is about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or
          85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay
          Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore
          Strait to the south along with the Riau Islands in Indonesia, the
          South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor along with the
          State of Johor in Malaysia to the north. Singapore's history dates
          back at least eight hundred years, having been a maritime emporium
          known as Temasek and subsequently a major constituent part of several
          successive thalassocratic empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819,
          when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrepôt trading
          post of the British Empire. In 1867, Singapore came under the direct
          control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. During World
          War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942 and returned to
          British control as a separate Crown colony following Japan's surrender
          in 1945. Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and, in 1963, became
          part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North
          Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences led to Singapore's
          expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an
          independent sovereign country in 1965. After early years of turbulence
          and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation
          rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers.
